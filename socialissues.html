  <h3 class=header3forum><i>Gun Violence</i></h3>
    <p class=forumentry>When will the numbers be high enough? High enough to coerce action from those once viciously apathetic, high enough to comprehend that money cannot purchase our way out of this problem? Will the bullet bodycount have to pierce through those close to us everyday, for change to be enacted? Must we all lose a loved one to our own manipulation of steel, our very creation of death, a gun, for the heads once dug in the sand of complacency and ignorance to raise from the ground and call for an end? Guns have never been merciful to bodies, bullets have been no beneficiary, shrapnel no savior; and yet we forgive the gun every time. lobbyists shout and scream, loud enough to drown out their dwindling morals, that guns don't kill people. that people kill people. As if the argument is that quick, that simple, that trivial, that black and white. For while people may be filled at times with an evil beyond ordinary comprehension, brimming with hate for another unlike ever before, there, in the vast complexities of the human mind, remains room for reconsideration. For the very pillars of humanity, of empathy and thoughtfulness, to perhaps seep in and slowly eradicate the cold intentions of murder. it is not the gun that stutters to pull the trigger. It is not the gun that hesitates, it is not the gun that thinks twice. instead, it entices. It is the convincing factor, that of accessibility and ease. it whispers to kill, and unlike the very lobbyists who perpetuate such policies, there are no internal ethics for these weapons to shout over. No remorse for the 20 children killed at sandy hook. no second thoughts for Trayvon Martin. No sympathy for the 49 in Orlando. Just cold, hard, unforgiving steel; and while we may know their names, the gun does not. Do not allow more names to be added to this list, for there is no political shout loud enough to drown out this moral obligation any longer.</p>

  <h3 class=header3forum><i>Food Industry</i></h3>
    <p class=forumentry>Take a child, and put them in a grocery store.Tell them they can have whatever they want, regardless of when dinner is or whether their mother will approve. Do not intervene, do not guide them with wisdom beyond their years. Merely watch. Merely observe, as the incessant and determined pattering of feet trail to the very thing they crave to consume. While perhaps once in a blue moon there will be a child hopelessly fascinated by a pint of blueberries, or wholeheartedly enveloped in the appearance of broccoli, or even perhaps woefully committed to a carton of eggs, it does not require excessive foresight to predict that those very feet you let run, will stop in their tracks for sugar. sugar, the amorphous beast, shape shifting from a liter of ice cream in aisle 12,  to a tray of cookies in aisle three. For while we are cajoled by doctors, while we see the very destruction done to our blood and our bones and our heart and our future, while we empty of all things nutritious  and good, we continue to fill with processed sugar. However, the true problem is not the availability of a substance more addictive than cocaine, leaving one itching craving begging for another blood spike; but rather that this very drug is marketed directly to the ones who have the most weight to gain, and the most to lose everywhere else. As unfortunate and unethical of a universality it may be, Industries have always capitalized on human weakness, on the inability to resist that of which is put in front of us, on the inescapable desire for satiation. But they have now grown restless, fatigued of adult weakness,craving  a prey far easier, far more easily addicted, and far more easily influenceable. Children. 
     You frown upon those who peddle addiction, monetize a myriad of substances, and deal in drugs, but you do not realize that such a capitalization of craving is far closer than you think, and you do not have to wait until night falls to fear this one. They are in broad daylight, biding time in the pantry. they are in the cereal aisle, as a happy leprechaun convinces a young, impressionable, hopeful being that they may find luck within obscene amounts of sugar. They are the faces of all the characters in entertainment your child absorbs religiously, plastered coyly onto juices void of nutrition, and flaunted upon  flavored snacks that within 8 small gummies promise to provide a dose ten times what one tastes- promoting a lifestyle that they would not dare to lead. They blare their blasphemy on Saturday mornings, inhabiting every channel your child has the imagination to turn to.

They know your child is just a child. 

And they do not feel pity. They will not mourn when a child is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at age 12, due to the products they put on the shelf. they will not cringe, as they see shots of insulin being injected,  as tears roll violently down the child's face; but rather rejoice at the addiction that led to such a state. They will smile, as new logos and new characters promise the young and innocent something better, and they will simultaneously sharpen the scythe of obesity, heart disease, diabetes- all within 35 grams of sweet, succulent, satisfying sugar. 
so if you do let your child off running in a grocery store, do not only remind them to be wary of strangers, but also towards the characters of familiarity, of influence, of invested trust, smiling up at them. They cannot fulfill the promises they make.

  <h3 class=header3forum><i>Political Involvement</i></h3>
    <p class=forumentry>for years, politics has been a ruthless game of influence, the two major factions vying for power over the masses, for the ability to mold and shape that of which we deem of importance and truth. But this game of circulating through a vast myriad of topics, each one a marionette in the nimble fingers of politics, foregoes any and all mention of the inescapable truth that is we as a species are destroying this planet. indulging in human selfishness and desire for satiation, we consume what the earth produces, without any regard to the undeniable evidence that proves that we are soon to run out of stock to supply such a high demand. At one point in time in the past, perhaps it was hard to impress the importance of this issue; there were no clear, stark, short-term terrors, no masses of people dying from a very clearly human-triggered environmental occurrence. on par with human nature, we procrastinated at that moment, coddling ourselves, and through the arrogance of our species we scoffed at the damage the earth swore was being done. But today, it is not so easy to continue to feed our disillusionment, to satiate the beast of ignorance any longer. we are not blind. We see the extinction of species at an unnatural rate, we see the loss of habitat, the destruction of coral reefs, the irregular permutations of the ocean currents, the astronomical levels of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, and we see what scientists are now beginning to term "The Sixth Extinction." but what we do not see, what we turn our heads with human hubris from , is the inability to procrastinate any longer. We turn away our dying earth at the door with a feigned and forced sense of confidence and complacency, continuing to blanket ourselves with daydreams of a better earth  and a cleaner existence, burdening future generations with the expectations that they will be the ones to complete such an arduous task. But it is not simply our own selves to blame. We, as humans, are flawed. we do not like to face uncertainty or fear, and do not, individually, thrive on ominous warnings that will undeniably come true. So who do we ask to guide us? to whom do we plea for aid, to whom do we bestow power upon and beg that they will use it to guide our people in what is right, good and necessary? In this plea, we created government. In this plea, we have created politicians. In this package of power they receive, from control of the media to the power of the pocketbook, by far the most significant is our trust- our faith that they will struggle as fiercely and as bravely as they can to forego human selfishness and flaw and do that of which will be best for the people; to attempt to polish the future so it may shine a little brighter. But in this centuries-long process, some have taken the polish that is power and put it in their own pocket, blinded by their own potential future to see that they are ignoring the country's. and within the endless cycle of  pushing their party, manipulating the media, and selling stale, empty promises, the earth is forgotten. all because no money is to be made from saving the earth. No money is to be made saving the polar bears, no financial gain to be acquired from demanding stricter pollution allowances from factories internationally. as if the loss of the earth means nothing in comparison to the personal fortune to be attained. Instead of foregoing flaw, they have magnified it. But unlike the small scale power of the individual, they hold the influence of a nation that impacts the entire world. This flaw is not so easy to ignore.  They have told you to ignore our impact on this earth on which we live, they have told you to look away from the murder of species we have been the accomplices in, they have told you to grant them a level of trust,  with a sparse artillery of white lies and hollow promises to make America great again, but they have not revealed to the power you, the mere flawed individual, holds. That your influence is not limited to electing them, and with every small action you make, with every letter, with every peaceful protest, with every demand for a future that isn't choking you with methane and carbon dioxide, you take a little bit of polish out of their hands and you do it yourself. And though the scale may start small, and significant change may feel distant and unattainable, know that the future is shining a little bit brighter, and you were a part of it.


the female gender has been over time fed this idea that we are the problem: our estrogen is our cyanide, causing us to slowly self destruct into emotional pettiness. That WE are the problem, that our one dimensional portrait in society's vast gallery of gender representation is somehow due to our inability to portray ourselves as more. But what we have been systemically blinded from, what has been clouding our self love, is NOT the shallow physical beauty we possess, nor the emotional fits that keep us up at night wondering if life will ever give us a chance comparable to those given to men, but rather the glaring fact that we are told that is all we are. when filled with a rage that brings tears to your eyes, and your hands quiver and your heart palpitates unforgivingly, YOU are not being petty. YOU are not doing anything wrong. then why, you ask, do you feel such reluctance when trying to express what is so bottled up inside you, vying for validation from those you care about? Why is it you dig your nails into your palms, count to ten, and whisper in your quivering courage that you are "fine"? it is because, no matter what fills inside of you, not even if what you feel is equivalent to that of your male counterparts, you have been told that to not be fine is not ok. that emotions beyond nurturing love is unattractive. and that is the ridiculous bullshit I wish to clear up, right now. you are NOT being petty, you are NOT being overly sensitive, you are NOT being dishonest, you are being human, multidimensional, in a world that painted you as a single image. so when you are told "calm down stop crying" when the tears only serve to release the pressure of what has been so contained through mandate from this warped society, show them your dimensions. tell them what is wrong, and do not make excuses for them or yourself. you have been told you are a goddess, you have been told you are above the "rage of men", that you are "ladylike," but you have not been told you are human. and you have not been told that that is ok. it is more than ok. it is essential. it is what makes you, you. please do not fear your rage or your tears: they are reminders of your humanity.
